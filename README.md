# HW1_IA

A project which demanded students to implement, in Python, known Local Search Algorithms:

- A*
- Bidirectional BFS
- Monte Carlo Tree Search
- A* with Pattern Database

And compare their execution time and consumed memory during the process of solving Rubik's Cube (Pocket Cube version, aka 2x2x2 dimension).
